  <div class="Description-heading">🏁 Project Goal</div>
  <p>We should know who is running our local, provincial and national governments</p>

  <p>Searching online for individuals you find in the news and conversation gives you the web pages that are most popular or relevant to what you're searching for. This does not necessarily give you a good overview with a broad range of reputable sources.</p>

  <p>It should be easy to learn about the political past of all publicly appointed officials.</p>

  <p><em>Public People</em> aims to give an overview of individuals holding public office or trying to do so, in a way that is easily understandable by the average person at a glance.</p>

  <div class="Description-heading">🛠️ Methodology</div>
  <p><em>Public People</em> sources public information about people of interest, and presents it in a way that makes it easy to get a fair and balanced overview of a person. Many skills are needed, not just technical. We welcome even unskilled contribution.</p>

  <div class="Description-heading">💌 Licensing</div>
  <p><em>Public People</em> is an Open Source project. Similarly to Wikipedia, Public People does not publish original content. All data must be sourced from reputable sources, with the license and attribution clearly cited.</p>

  <p>The software for the project is available at <a class="Link" href="https://github.com/public-people">https://github.com/public-people</a>.</p>
